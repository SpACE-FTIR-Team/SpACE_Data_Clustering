# SpACE_Data_Clustering

In simple terms, the project is a software system that will take data and do clustering.
More specifically, the project is a Windows-based, graphical user interface (GUI) software
system that will allow a user to import data and perform K-means and DBSCAN algorithms to
cluster the data.
The project will use data from NASA’s ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment
on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) Spectral Library – Version 1.0. The library contains infrared
spectra for thousands of substances measured in a variety of different laboratories. The data
will need to be preprocessed and possibly will need to be normalized prior to clustering. The
option to select subsets of the data and get results from the intermediary phases of analysis
may also be included.
